# Hacking Hogwarts

This project is accomplished using Object Oriented Programming Paradigm.
The reason I use OOP is to be able to separate different entities into objects, therefore making it easier to separate the design into the MVC pattern, and then instanciate entities from a major class, like Student, Info, Controller, View, Model and the App itself.

## Code Organisation

To organise the code, I use JavaScript modules, so I can separate each class into one file, and then have access to all files by importing and exporting the files. This approach allowed me to have multiple files with few lines, instead of one file with multiple lines. By having fewer lines, I am able to find the code I want with ease.
